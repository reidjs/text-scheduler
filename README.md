# Text Scheduler
Schedule iMessage, SMS, and WhatsApp messages from `.txt` files from your Mac.

# Send messages
1. Clone this repo to your computer.
2. Open `SETTINGS.txt` and replace the number after `myself=...` to **an iMessage capable phone number**. 
3. Open your terminal to this project directory and run these commands in order
   1. `virtualenv venv`
   2. `source activate.sh` 
   3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   4. `python send_scheduled_messages.py`
4. ðŸ’¬ If everything went well, you should receive an iMessage text that says "Hello from iMessage!", an SMS text that says "Hello from SMS!", and a WhatsApp message that says "Hello from WhatsApp".


# How it works
The script parses files in the `scheduled_messages` directory that follow this filename format: `{Message|SMS|WhatsApp} {person} {datetime}.txt`. You can set this directory in the SETTINGS.txt file. Every file with a `{datetime}` after your system's current datetime will be sent immediately*.  

1. The first word in the filename must be either `Message` to send via iMessage, or `SMS` to send via SMS, or `WhatsApp` to send via WhatsApp.
2. The second word, `{person}` must be the persons identifier. This is set in SETTINGS.txt, e.g., `bob=1234567890` would set `bob`'s phone number to `1234567890`.
3. Everything following the name, before the .txt, is considered the `{datetime}`. Many formats may work, but this is the only one I have tested: `Month D, YYYY HH:MM(AM|PM)`, for example `March 9, 2024 7:25AM`. You can also use the keyword `now` or `asap` as the `datetime` to send texts immediately.
4. After a text is sent, it will move the file to the `sent` folder in your `scheduled_texts` directory. 

**Will only send texts with `{datetime}` less than MAX_OVERTIME_MINS, 30 minutes by default. This is to prevent accidentally sending really old messages. For example, if you had this script running on a cron that failed then restarted a week later, you probably don't want those week-old messages to send.*

# GUI
A GUI is provided if you are willing to add another dependency via
```
pip install PyQt5
```
This allows you to interface a little more easily. Although non-obvious, the timing boxes at the bottom of the GUI are **scrollable**. 
Although not as visually appealing as the iPhone alarm/countdown timer scheduler, it works roughly the same.
If you wish to send now, simply don't change the time...it always defaults to the current time.
On top of this, adding/changing numbers can also be driven through the GUI. Examples below.

You can easily add new contacts with form `contact=number` as shown below.

You can also change someone's number with the same syntax. Note that this will be automatically overwritten. If you wish for this to throw an error instead, change the `overwrite` default behavior in `gui.py`.

Below is a summary of the side effects. The second screenshot is there to simply show that the GUI ONLY writes text files; it does not run the `send_scheduled_message.py` script.

![What the updated SETTINGS.txt file will look like](gui_pngs/gui_side_effect.png)

![GUI only writes files, does not send them](gui_pngs/gui_doesnt_send_messages.png)

If you wish to have both where the GUI can flip a flag where you might want to send messages, then I would suggest adding the function outlined in `bash_shortcut.sh` to your `bashrc` (or whatever shell you use) file. `stxt` will not send messages, and `stxt 1` will go ahead and send all queued messages.

# Dev Notes
To add a new dependency to requirements.txt, run
`python3 -m  pipreqs.pipreqs .`
